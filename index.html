        <p>The kodkod is the smallest wildcat found in the Americas, but don't let its size fool you. The kodkod is a ferocious hunter which stalks and kills various small lizards, birds and rodents. It also enjoys snacking on moths and other insects.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The kodkod lives in the temperate rainforests of Chile and Argentina, and its habitat is threatened by persistent logging in that region. Please donate today to protect this adorable - yet fierce - creature!</p>
